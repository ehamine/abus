#summary Brainstorming notes for the design of the A-Bus

= Introduction =

This page contains brainstorming notes for the design of the A-Bus.

The A-Bus is expected to fulfill common IPC needs in embedded systems.

It has to be light, efficient, and comfortable. Although A-Bus borrows some concepts from D-Bus, in no ways it is a Desktop bus.

The A-Bus also seeks to make re-use/access documention of existing services easier for the developer, following inspiration from plugin declaration in gstreamer.

NB: page to be refactored as scope of work, specs, implementation guidelines,..

= Details =

 * Service/object paradigm
  * rpc and events
  * publish/subscribe model for events
  * expose properties
  * addressable by (string) name
  * Like D-Bus, the A-Bus object's names are namespaced
  * Objects shall register with their PID, proto bearer and location(url?) at the `abus-daemon`. Clients don't need to.
 * Flexible RPC, marshaling based on [http://json-rpc.org/ JSON-RPC]
 * Calls can be synchronous or asynchronous (thanks to JSON-RPC's "id")
  * if async, response interpreted as an event
  * callback based
  * built-in timeout handling
 * Shall work transparently:
  * local to a multi-thread process
  * local to a host (OS)
  * across network
 * Direct communication between programs, no use of broker but a name server `abus-daemon` (kind of portmapper) or file system and a client-side cache
 * Allow more than one protocol bearer
  * inter-thread comm with a process (which IPC?)
  * UNIX socket
  * TCP socket
  * HTTP?
  * [http://tipc.sourceforge.net/ TIPC], ...
 * Endian-agnostic thanks to [http://json.org/ JSON]
 * Explicit method declaration server-side, semi-automatically connected to language functions
  * -> allow automated type-validation of `"params"`
  * -> allow to browse service
  * -> automatic documentation (extract doxy)?
  * Use swig for automatic attributes/method export?
 * glib-friendly (g_object & mainloop), but without depending on it -> `libgabus`
 * written in C for POSIX systems
  * wrappers made available thanks to [http://swig.org swig]

== libabus ==

This is an end-user library.

 * libabus provides client as well as server helpers
 * embeds a tailored JSON parser
 * handling call timeouts
 * offer built-in timer support (as events) ?
 * recommend to be hosted in its own thread, but not strong requirement
 * `send/append message(obj_dest, args:"%d%d%s%10f", &a, &b, s, tab)` + extra format for blobs, ..
 * blob friendly with transparent escaping with JSON format
 * Properties
  * simplify exposing(server-side) and getting/setting(client-side) of properties (aka attributes)
   * ala sysfs or g_object, but requiring neither of them
   * offer subscribe "upon_change" of a property
   * recommended convention: subdir in namespace for state & config. Or simply use Read only & Read Write flags.
   * type self-declaration ala g_param_spec_int() et al., but without requiring glib
    * would allow property inspector tool

== `abus-daemon` ==

The `abus-daemon` is mainly a name server through UNIX proto.

Rem: the publish is not done by `abus-daemon`, but server-side.

Robustness: every server must keep a descriptor open with the `abus-daemon`. Should the descriptor close, they must attempt to reopen an re-register (resync).

== Wishlist ==

 * easy to build (distributed) state machines
 * service/objects compatible with json-rpc, callable from outside world (e.g. JavaScript, ..) through bearer proxy (HTTP or TCP)
 * optional for local rpc (same process/host): transparent binary encoding (TLV)
 * security: to be addressed when going multi host
 * easy to connect to [http://code.google.com/p/klish/ klish]
 * easy to connect to snmp
